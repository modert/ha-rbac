"""The filtering reverse proxy.

Modelled on `homeassistant/components/hassio/ingress.py`, which is the working
reverse proxy already in the tree.

Two constraints shape everything here. The proxy must be mounted at `/` and must
not touch paths or query strings, because signed URLs (`authSig`) are an HMAC
over the exact path and the ordered list of non-safe query parameters, and the
signing secret lives in `hass.data` where it cannot be re-created. And the
proxy must never send a command upstream on a client's websocket, because
message ids have to increase strictly per connection -- being in-process, it
reads the registries directly instead.

    The default is refusal. An unfilterable response for a request that named
    no resources is the one case where nothing has been checked at all -- not
    the request, because it named nothing, and not the response, because it
    could not be parsed -- so the only safe answer is to refuse unless the shape
    itself rules entity state out.

    Two earlier forms of this both failed, in opposite directions:

    - "Is this textual?", refusing everything textual outside a short allowlist.
      The allowlist named `text/css` and `application/javascript` but not
      `application/manifest+json`, `text/plain` or `text/html`, so a restricted
      user got a 403 for the PWA manifest, `/api/onboarding` and the frontend
      index. The companion app fetches those on every connect and hung on the
      loading screen after login.
    - "Is this exactly `application/json`?", which emptied the guard instead of
      tightening it. `_filter_http_body` already returns `filterable=True` for
      parseable `application/json`, so a JSON body never reaches the refusal
      branch; what reaches it is oversized or unparseable JSON plus every
      genuinely non-JSON body. Answering "no" for all of those forwarded them
      unfiltered -- a fail-open.

    So each exemption is earned rather than assumed, and this function is only
    half of it. The other half is provenance, at the call site: a body Home
    Assistant handed straight off disk cannot carry live entity state whatever
    its content type, which is what stays closed as Home Assistant adds new
    static content types. This function answers only for shapes.

    `text/plain` is deliberately absent, because plain text is a perfectly good
    carrier of entity state -- a rendered template is exactly that. The
    plain-text responses requirement 3.3 protects are covered without exempting
    the type: `/local/` and `/frontend_latest/` are directory listings served off
    disk, so provenance covers them, and `/api/onboarding` on an onboarded
    instance is Home Assistant's own `404: Not Found`, which the call site
    forwards as an upstream error rather than as a body worth trusting. A 200
    `text/plain` body from a view stays refused.

    Known residual risk, per the design: `text/html` is exempt on the strength
    of Home Assistant rendering state client-side, so a custom integration that
    rendered entity state into HTML would be forwarded. Narrowable later by
    scoping that entry to non-`/api/` paths if it proves to matter.

    app requests `/api/ios/config` on every launch, reads anything but the 404 as
    an auth failure, and loops on token refresh until onboarding hangs. It is
    also what `/api/onboarding` answers on an onboarded instance, which is the
    only way a restricted user can see that path at all -- during onboarding
    proper there is no signed-in user, so the response is never filtered.

    Scoped to error statuses on purpose, so it cannot excuse a body a view
    produced: an error body is Home Assistant's framing, and the residual risk
    is a view that reported entity state in a plain-text error, which none in
