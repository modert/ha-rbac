"""The decision procedure.

Four gates, in order of cost: a pass-through fast path, the tier gate derived
from Home Assistant's own decorators, a resource check, and the boundedness rule.

The shape of the whole thing follows from one observation: reads and mutations
fail differently. A read leaks through its *response*, so it can be allowed and
its response filtered -- a command returning nothing resource-shaped needs no
classification at all. A mutation's damage is not visible in the response, so it
has to be judged up front.

        Entity permission is the wrong granularity for a select whose options

        name on it, and a role that may announce for one person should not be
        able to announce as another. So a rule narrows the options rather than
        the entity, and the entity grant stays what it was.

        Three ways to reach an option, and all three are judged. `select_option`
        names the one it wants. The cycling four name none and would walk to any
        option in the list, so they are refused outright for a covered entity --
        there is no way to tell where they will land without tracking the
        entity's current position, and guessing would be guessing in the
        permissive direction. `set_options` rewrites the list itself, which
        would let a forbidden option be made permitted first.

        Judged against every covered entity the payload names rather than
        matching each call to its own target: a payload naming two selects and
        one option is asking for that option on both as far as anything here
        can tell, and refusing is the direction to be wrong in.

        `called` is the service a REST path names. `POST
        /api/services/input_select/select_option` is the same request as a
        `call_service` command with the two halves of the name in the URL,
