"""Role model and permission evaluation.

Home Assistant's own policy compiler is reused rather than forked, but it cannot
express denial: `compile_policy` maps any bool -- including `False` -- to
allow-all, and `SINGLE_ENTITY_SCHEMA` accepts only the literal `True`. So each
role compiles *two* policies, an allow and a deny, and the deny vetoes.

Deny is deliberately coarse: denying a domain denies everything in it, and a
narrower deny entry cannot rescue one member. HA's `apply_policy_funcs` reads an
empty entry as "no opinion" and falls through to the broader rule, and there is
no way to express False to stop it. Since the allow side is default-deny, a
carve-out is written there instead -- grant the one entity rather than deny the
domain and punch a hole in it.
