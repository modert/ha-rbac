# How it works

The reference for anyone extending this, reviewing it, or wondering why a particular request was refused. The [README](../README.md) is the short version.

## Design

The permission surface is **derived from Home Assistant's own runtime registries**, not from a table that has to be updated every release:

| Source | Yields |
| --- | --- |
| `hass.data["websocket_api"]` | every websocket command and its voluptuous schema |
| the handler's `__wrapped__` chain | whether Home Assistant marks the command admin-only |
| `hass.http.app.router` and the view subclasses | the REST surface and its auth requirements |
| the panel registry | every dashboard, add-on and built-in screen |
| entity / device / area / label / floor registries | the resource graph |

If that derivation ever stops working, the catalog reports itself **degraded** and every request is refused. The failure direction for an introspection-based scheme is otherwise silent and open, which is the worst way for it to break.

## Why this is not a core patch

Home Assistant's architecture discussion [#1374](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/discussions/1374) is a worked RBAC proposal for core -- deny-overrides-allow, label-based entity permissions, custom role CRUD, per-service and per-automation categories -- with a branch behind it. It was declined, and so was a follow-up asking for about eighty lines: `AuthManager` group CRUD, and widening the policy schema to accept `False`.

The reason given was not disagreement about the feature. It was that authentication and authorization need "significant care and oversight from the Foundation, well beyond just code review" -- external audits, ongoing security monitoring, long-term maintenance -- and those resources are not allocated.

Two things follow for this project. Waiting for either change would be waiting indefinitely, which is why deny is expressed by compiling two policies rather than by asking the schema to accept `False`, and why roles live in this integration's own store rather than in `.storage/auth`. And the same reasoning applies here with the same force: this layer has had two adversarial passes by its author and no external audit, which is what the alpha warning is about.

The proposal is worth reading anyway. It is an independent design of the same thing, and the places it reaches that this does not -- per-automation `read`, `edit` and `trigger` in particular -- are a fair list of what is still missing.

## The gates

A request passes through these in order, and the first refusal wins.

**1. Pass-through.** The owner, Home Assistant's own system users, and any role that restricts nothing skip every parse. This is the fast path that keeps the proxy cheap for administrators. A role only counts as unrestricted if it really is: an attribute rule, an app list or a tier denial all disqualify it.

**2. Tier gate.** Home Assistant marks its own administrative commands with `require_admin`, and that marking is read at runtime. This covers most of the command surface without naming any of it. REST routes are derived separately, sorted by specificity rather than length so a catch-all cannot outrank a specific path; an unmatched route is treated as administrative.

One exception to that default: a path Home Assistant serves straight off disk. Static paths are not views, so they match no route and used to resolve to administrative -- which refused a signed-in restricted user a file Home Assistant hands to anyone at all, the proxy included, since the same request without a token is forwarded and answered. `/local`, the frontend bundles and any integration's own static path are read back off the running router and count as open. Views are consulted first, so a static path cannot lower the tier of an endpoint underneath it.

**3. App gate.** Hiding a dashboard, add-on or screen from the sidebar is cosmetic on its own, since the address bar still works, so the ways into a denied one are refused too. Three matches, in order of precision: the request names the app outright (`lovelace/config` carries its own `url_path`), an add-on is reached through a Supervisor endpoint naming its slug, or the convention that an app's data comes from commands sharing its name.

That last one is a guess, and it has an exception. `config/` is not the Settings panel's namespace, it is Home Assistant's namespace for every registry, and the area, device, entity and floor lists behind it are what any dashboard reads before it can draw. So for Settings the convention is narrowed to requests that change something.

**4. Resource gate.** A recursive walk of the payload collects `entity_id`, `device_id`, `area_id`, `label_id`, `floor_id` and `target`, expands them through the registries, and requires every resulting entity to be permitted. Path and query parameters are folded in for REST, because `?filter_entity_id=` names its own target and a minimal history response would not give it back.

Those keys are not the only place an entity is named. `scene.apply` takes `{"entities": {"lock.front": "unlocked"}}`, where the entity is a mapping *key*, and a media source names one in the tail of a URI, `media-source://camera/camera.bedroom`. Neither can be recognised by shape alone — the tail of `media-source://media_source/local/song.mp3` looks exactly the same — so a second walk tests every string and every key against the registry and folds in whatever really is an entity. It adds to the check without counting as a bound, so a payload that names nothing a schema recognises stays unbounded and is judged as before.

**5. Boundedness gate.** A payload that names nothing does not constrain its own command. The rule that decides this is:

> **A payload does not bound its command if it carries a template.** A Jinja
> template's reach is unrelated to the resources the payload names, so any
> string containing `{{` or `{%` makes the command unbounded regardless of what
> else it declares.

This is what stops `render_template`, whose schema carries an optional `entity_ids` that is a *rendering hint* rather than a constraint: without the rule, extraction would check a decoy list and allow arbitrary server-side Jinja.

An earlier formulation of this rule was "an optional resource field does not bound a command". That is wrong, and testing it against the real schemas is how we found out: `call_service` declares `vol.Optional("target")`, so it would have refused every control action in Home Assistant. Scanning for the template markers is also strictly stronger, because it catches a template hidden in `service_data` that no schema-shape rule can see, and because it correctly *allows* `group/start_preview` and the other previews that really are bounded by the entities they name. Only `template/start_preview` evaluates arbitrary Jinja.

A service call that names no entity is not unbounded either, it is bounded by the service: `persistent_notification.create` and `homeassistant.restart` target nothing, and refusing the lot left a role unable to raise a notification.

## Responses

Reads are allowed and their **responses filtered**. Leakage from a read is by definition in the response, so a command returning nothing resource-shaped needs no classification at all. Mutations are gated up front instead, since their damage is not visible in what comes back.

The standing weakness of that design is that the generic walk recognises one spelling of a thing and Home Assistant has several: `entity_id` and `ei`, `attributes` and `a`. Each abbreviation is a potential leak and they cannot be enumerated in advance, which is the argument for re-running an adversarial sweep periodically rather than trusting the walk.

Position varies as well as spelling. Cameras are a media source, so `media_source/browse_media` listed every one of them — friendly name and `/api/camera_proxy/` thumbnail — after the same cameras had been hidden from the sidebar, the states and the registry listings, because the entity sits in the tail of a `media-source://` URI rather than under any key. That has its own filter now, and the request side refuses to resolve one, which matters more: `media_source/resolve_media` returns a signed stream URL that authenticates on its own, so nothing downstream could have recovered what the request gave away.

Shape varies too, and in two ways the walk cannot reach. Some responses key a structure by the thing it describes rather than naming it inside: history and statistics answer `{entity_id: [samples]}` and `{statistic_id: [rows]}`, where a sample names no entity of its own, and the REST history endpoint answers as a list of lists with `entity_id` on the first sample of each series alone, so dropping that first sample left every minimised one behind it. Others name an entity under a key that is not `entity_id` at all: `context_entity_id` on a logbook row, `stat_energy_from` and `entity_energy_price` in the energy preferences, `ei` in the compact registry listing. And some name it as a bare string in a list, which the walk, looking for an object's own field, never inspects: `search/related` answers `{item_type: [ids]}`.

Each of those has its own filter now. What they have in common is that none of them was findable by reading the walk; each was found by asking a restricted role what came back.

A response too large to filter is refused rather than streamed. A size limit is not a correctness boundary, so it fails closed.

## What a role carries

- **Entities**: a baseline plus exceptions, targeted by area, domain, label, floor, entity or device. Home Assistant's own `compile_entities` does the evaluation, compiled twice per role because it cannot express denial: `allow_fn(x) and not deny_fn(x)`. Areas, labels and floors are desugared to entity ids at compile time, which also sidesteps a bug in Home Assistant's own area lookup that ignores an entity's directly assigned area.
- **Attributes**: names withheld from entities the role can otherwise see, targeted the same way. The compressed diffs carry attribute *names*, so stripping the same names from the initial state, the additions and the removal list is enough for the client's picture to stay consistent. Removals matter as much as values: `{"-": {"a": ["latitude"]}}` names an attribute without its value, which still discloses that it exists.
- **History** and **Logbook**: the recorded *past* of entities the role may not be able to read live, targeted the same way. One mechanism with two sections, named in `GRANT_SECTIONS`: one rule shape, one compiler, one union, and one row per section in `decide.PAST_GRANTS` saying which reads it widens and which panel it hides behind. The sections are independent, because a trend and a timeline are different disclosures: "the house was cold on Tuesday" is not "somebody turned the heating down at 9pm".

  Additive and read-only, and a denial always wins: the household-wide deny vetoes a grant outright, and within a role its own deny clause does, so a broad grant cannot resurrect what the role withheld. Both gates are widened rather than the check itself, and only for reads: the resource gate so a granted-but-unreadable entity gets past it (every one of these reads is bounded, because Home Assistant requires `entity_ids`, `statistic_ids` or `filter_entity_id` on all of them), and the app gate so a role can hide the panel and still be handed one entity out of it. The response filter is what narrows the answer, so letting the command through discloses nothing wider.

  A rule that names no ids grants nothing, which is the opposite of how an attribute rule reads its empty case. The difference is direction: an attribute rule withholds, so "every entity" is the conservative reading, while these grant, so it is the dangerous one. A role posted with a blank rule was handed the recorded history of a whole instance.
- **Apps**: which sidebar entries the role may open. Dashboards carry a level as well: a role can open one empty, or read what is on it. That is resolved against the dashboard when a request is judged rather than recorded when the role is saved, so a dashboard being edited changes who can see what without anyone reopening the role. The entity list per dashboard is cached and refreshed on Home Assistant's own `lovelace_updated` event, because it is consulted on the hottest path there is. A denial is checked first, so putting a forbidden entity on a granted dashboard does not unlock it, which would otherwise hand a grant to anyone who can edit a dashboard.

  A dashboard widens *reading* and nothing else. There was a third level once, which granted control of whatever the dashboard showed, and it was the same hole read from the other end: dashboards are editable -- by a non-admin too, where the role holds the `dashboards` capability -- so dropping an entity onto a granted dashboard handed out control the role's own entity list never gave. Control comes from the entity list alone. A role stored with the retired level reads as the level below it rather than being rejected, because a role that fails validation is skipped whole and would take the access it still describes correctly with it.
- **Commands**: ordinary use, or everything including settings, plus any *capabilities* — named parts of the administrative surface, so that granting automations or dashboards does not mean writing a glob. A role stores the names rather than the patterns they expand to, which is what lets the editor show what was chosen and lets a role follow the grouping when Home Assistant moves a command under it. An unknown name grants nothing and is kept, since a role written by a newer build should lose that one grant rather than all of them. What the grouping cannot make safe is that automations, scripts and scenes run with no user context: whoever can write one can make it do anything, so those capabilities record trust rather than confine it.
- **Schedule**: a list of windows, each with its own days and times. The role is in force if any window is open. A window whose end precedes its start runs through midnight and belongs to the day it *opened*, so Friday 22:00 to 02:00 is in force at one on Saturday morning. Outside every window the role is not held at all, and holding no role means no access rather than the access an unbound user would get; falling back would *raise* an administrator's access the moment their restricted role expired.

Because a schedule changes what applies without anything being edited, permissions are cached on the user *and* on which of their roles are currently in force, and a websocket re-resolves them per frame. A connection stays open for hours, which is the same span a schedule covers.

## Choices on a select

Entity permission is the wrong granularity for a select whose options are people. Control of `input_select.announcing` is control of every name on it, so a role that may announce for one person can announce as another. A role can therefore narrow the *options* on the selects it names, leaving the entity grant alone.

Three ways to reach an option, and the gate judges all three:

- `select_option` names the one it wants, which is checked against the rule.
- `select_next`, `select_previous`, `select_first` and `select_last` name none. Where they land depends on where the select already is, so there is no way to judge them without tracking its position, and guessing would guess in the permissive direction. They are refused outright on a covered entity.
- `set_options` rewrites the list itself, which would let a forbidden option be made permitted first. Also refused.

The payload is walked rather than read at the top level, because `execute_script` carries its calls in a sequence. A payload naming two covered selects and one option is judged as asking for that option on both: matching each call to its own target is more precision than the walk has, and refusing is the direction to be wrong in.

An entity no rule covers is untouched, and a role with no rules never enters the gate.

## Multiple roles

A user can hold more than one role at once. Each of the user's active roles (active meaning bound and currently in force by its own schedule) is compiled and checked on its own; nothing about the roles themselves is merged. A check then asks each role in turn and grants access if **any** role says yes -- `check_entity` is a plain `any(role.check(entity_id, key) for role in roles)`, and the same shape covers tiers and apps. So two roles with conflicting exceptions on the same entity resolve to the more permissive of the two: a role that hides an entity does not override another role that grants it, even though *within* a single role deny still beats allow.

Roles are meant to be composed rather than layered: build the narrowest role that covers the common case, then add a second role for the extra access someone occasionally needs, rather than relying on one role's deny to trim another's allow.

The one grant nothing can widen is the per-user global deny. It is checked before any role is consulted and vetoes a request outright, regardless of what any role would otherwise allow.

## Recording what a role needs

Writing a role blind is the hard way round: restrict something, hand it over, and find out days later that a dashboard is empty. So a role can be put into recording. While it runs, its holders skip every gate and each request is noted instead of judged -- the same extraction the resource gate performs, used to write down rather than to refuse. Responses are not filtered either, since a recording that trimmed them would be recording a smaller Home Assistant than the one the person is actually using.

The check sits *above* the gates on purpose. A recording that only saw what the role already allows would tell nobody anything; the point is to learn what it was missing, and a refused request never says what it wanted.

What comes out is only ever additive. A recording says what was needed, never what was not: an entity nobody happened to open while it ran has not been shown to be unnecessary, so nothing it produces can take access away.

Two consequences of it being a temporary grant of full access. It is loud -- the panel carries a warning while it runs and the log says so at the start. And it lives in memory only, so a restart or an unload ends every recording and the role goes back to its own rules. That loses the notes, which is the cheaper of the two failures: persisting the flag would mean a crash mid-recording left a role unrestricted with nobody watching.

The app match is shared with the app gate rather than reimplemented, because the recording needs the same answer for the opposite purpose. Two copies that had to agree would be the defect, not the duplication.

## Add-on ingress

`HassIOIngress` sets `requires_auth = False`, so an add-on's own web page arrives with no bearer token and the ordinary path can resolve no user for it. Denying an add-on would hide its panel and refuse its Supervisor endpoints while leaving the add-on itself reachable by anyone holding its ingress path, which is stable for the life of the installation.

The only identity such a request carries is the `ingress_session` cookie, and that session is minted through a Supervisor command the proxy does see, on a connection it has already authenticated. So the proxy records who each session was issued to, resolves the request's token back to an add-on, and applies the role. A session it never issued belongs to nobody and is refused.

## Read this first: the security boundary

**RBAC applies only to traffic through the proxy. Home Assistant must not be reachable from the network, or the proxy is decorative.**

The setup flow does this, and `http_config.py` is where. Home Assistant cannot change its HTTP config while running -- a config is *staged*, applied on the next start, and reverted automatically unless something promotes it within five minutes -- so the move is one restart rather than a live reconfiguration.

That trial is what makes automating it safe. The promotion is deferred until the proxy has served a real request through the new arrangement, so a proxy that binds its port but cannot forward leaves the revert armed and Home Assistant comes back where it was. Binding is not evidence of serving, which is why the check is a request and not a socket.

By hand it is three steps and the order is not guessable: move the port first, install this, then set the server host to `127.0.0.1`, all under **Settings >
System > Network**. Each step leaves a reachable instance, and taking the port before Home Assistant has vacated it is a bind error rather than a working setup.

`127.0.0.1` is doing the work here, not any firewall. It is the only address Home Assistant will accept a connection on, so after that setting it is not listening on the network at all and `8124` cannot be opened from off the machine. This layer is in-process and reaches it over the same loopback address, so it never needs the port exposed. That holds identically on Home Assistant OS, Supervised, Container and Core. Not publishing `8124` in Docker is worth doing as well, but it is not what makes this safe, and publishing it would not undo the setting either.

> On recent Home Assistant versions the `http:` block in `configuration.yaml` is
> ignored: that configuration was migrated into Home Assistant's own store, and
> editing the YAML afterwards changes nothing and raises a repair issue saying
> so.

This matters because **an access token is not port-scoped**. A token minted through the proxy works verbatim against Home Assistant's own listener. If the server host is unset, reverted during an upgrade, or the port is published, every user's existing token grants full unfiltered access and nothing warns you at request time. The integration checks this at startup and logs loudly, but it cannot enforce it.

Taking `8123` for the proxy rather than the other way round is deliberate: the origin every browser, phone and cloud integration already uses does not change, so no session is invalidated and nothing needs repointing.

### What this does and does not protect against

**Holds against anyone on the network.** A household member with a valid login cannot read or control what their role forbids, from a browser, the app or the API.

**Does not hold against anyone with host access.** Loopback is reachable with a shell or code execution on the machine, and anyone with that can read `.storage/auth`, which contains every refresh token and its signing key. They can mint an access token for the owner and bypass Home Assistant's own authentication entirely, not just this layer. That is a precondition which already loses, so the proxy does not try to close it.

**Companion webhooks are attributed after decryption.** The proxy still forwards `/api/webhook/{id}` for Core to authenticate. For `mobile_app`, a guard on Core's command dispatcher resolves the registration's stored `user_id` and applies the current policy before the handler runs. It covers HTTP, WebSocket and cloudhook delivery through that dispatcher, including encrypted registrations. Unknown commands are refused to restricted accounts. See [the operation-by-operation boundary](COMPANION_WEBHOOKS.md).

**Other integrations' webhooks remain outside this boundary.** They have no common user ownership or command format. A bearer identity attached to an arbitrary webhook is not evidence of who owns it. Such integrations need their own ownership and operation adapter; they must not be blanket-blocked or silently assigned the caller's role.

Three consequences worth stating plainly:

- A **non-admin with a legitimate shell account** on the host is not contained. The answer is to not give them a shell, or to run Home Assistant in a container they cannot enter.
- Under Supervisor, **add-ons reach Home Assistant over the Supervisor Unix socket** and auto-authenticate with no token at all. Any add-on with `homeassistant_api: true` is outside this boundary. The loopback setting itself is fine on Supervised: Supervisor reaches Home Assistant over that socket rather than the network port.

### Recovery if you lock yourself out

The owner account is always pass-through, in code, and cannot be restricted from the UI. Failing that, tunnel to Home Assistant directly:

```bash
ssh -L 8124:127.0.0.1:8124 <your-ha-host>
# then browse http://localhost:8124 for unfiltered stock Home Assistant
```

Or delete `.storage/ha_rbac.roles` and restart to return to derived defaults. If the integration itself fails to load, nothing answers on either port, and the setting has to be undone instead: remove `server_host` from the `stable` block of `.storage/http` and restart.

Removing or disabling the integration does that undoing for you. Stopping the proxy frees the address but leaves Home Assistant on loopback, so on its own it would take the instance off the network entirely and getting back in would need a shell. So the move is reversed and Home Assistant restarts onto the address it answered on before, using the snapshot taken when it was moved. The restore is promoted straight to stable rather than staged: a staged config is a trial that reverts unless something confirms it, and the thing that would confirm it is the integration being removed. An installation moved by a build older than this has no snapshot, so the port the proxy is on is used instead, which is the address Home Assistant was on by definition. Turn it off per entry with **Put Home Assistant back on its original address** if you would rather it stayed put.

Every one of those needs access to the machine, so confirm you have some before enabling enforcement rather than after. On Home Assistant OS and Supervised that is not the Terminal & SSH add-on by default: add-ons are bridge-networked, so `127.0.0.1` inside one is the add-on and the tunnel reaches nothing, and the web terminal is served through the Home Assistant that is down. The add-on can still edit `.storage/http`, which it mounts read-write, if it has a real SSH port rather than ingress alone.

## Known limitations

- **Binary websocket frames are relayed unfiltered.** The handler id is per-connection and the payload is opaque. The commands that negotiate them are admin-gated today, which is not the same as being safe forever.
- **Automations execute with no user context**, unchanged from stock Home Assistant.
- **Assist is granted or withheld, not filtered.** A sentence names no entity until Home Assistant resolves it, and by the time the result comes back the action has happened, so the whole intent surface is refused for any role that restricts anything. A role allowed to control its own lights still cannot ask Assist to turn them on. Both spellings are refused, the websocket command `conversation/process` and the service `conversation.process`: a glob written for one does not match the other, and denying only the command left the service open until v0.15.1. [ASSIST.md](ASSIST.md) is what enforcing it rather than refusing it would take.
- **A schedule bounds when, not when-from.** `active_at` asks whether a role is in force *now*; nothing consults it about the period a request asks about. So a role scheduled for Tuesday mornings is unrestricted in time while it is active, and can read the whole recorded history of every entity it may see. History is filtered by *what* the role reaches, so a hidden entity is absent from it unless a History or Logbook grant names it deliberately, but anything the role reaches is visible for all of its past. Scoping history to a role's windows would mean filtering individual samples by timestamp on the largest responses Home Assistant sends, and deciding what "its windows" means for a recurring schedule; neither is settled. Raised as #37.
- **Timing and existence oracles.** A denied entity is distinguishable from one that does not exist. A frame that filters to nothing is dropped rather than forwarded empty, so a restricted connection does not get one per state change in the house; the exception is the opening frame of the two subscriptions whose client blocks on it, which is answered once with the empty frame Home Assistant itself would send. Returning an emptied frame every time, which is what the first fix for that hang did, made a read-nothing role a real-time activity clock: five toggles of a light it could not read produced five frames. `tests/test_proxy.py` pins both halves.
- **Out-of-band capability URLs.** A signed path minted for the read-only content user erases the requesting user. Camera tokens are covered because the entity's whole state is filtered, but a URL obtained another way still works until it rotates, and rotation is Home Assistant's, not ours.
- **Filtering costs CPU, but less than expected.** Home Assistant builds each state-diff payload once and shares it with every client; filtering per user gives that up. Measured, a state-change diff costs about 5 microseconds to parse, filter and re-serialise, so fifty browser tabs at a hundred state changes a second come to roughly 2% of one core. A per-role cache was considered and dropped: Home Assistant gives each connection its own subscription id, so the frames are not byte-identical across connections and you have to parse before you could key a cache, which is most of the cost already. `tests/test_performance.py` pins the measurement.
